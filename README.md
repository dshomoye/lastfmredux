## LFRedux
I mostly built this as a way to easily archive my scrobbles from LastFM. 
I just wanted to have a sort of "backup". The service is here now but who knows the future?
I added 4 visualizations (so far) just as a way to see some very basic patterns that are behind a paywall on LastFM. I'm not mad they want money, but *my* listening patterns isn't something I want to pay to see.

Built with React on NextJS and:

- mongodb atlas
- [@nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) for some visualizations
- [sunburst chart](https://github.com/vasturiano/sunburst-chart)
